# PEAK FREQUENCY FILTER

  In this repository, I implemented a peak frequency filter for a sample audio file. At first, I created a lowpass filter. 
Then, I changed the number of frequencies used for filtering, from 1000 to 4000. Finally,
I plotted the number of peaks I found versus changing Cutoff frequencies.
